![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/MyMug150_2014.gif)This is a hybrid class and we will meet for one class per week and you will need to work through the course material online each week and do the weekly quiz covering the online content. Most of the content provided covers computing from a business perspective to support the *strategic objectives* of the business. The goal of using information systems is to enable strategic outcomes to achieve competitive advantage.  

If you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:

[![ebook]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.pdf) UMUC has moved to free online resources to support all courses and there is a free 167 page eBook titled [Information Systems for Business and Beyond]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.pdf). The eBook contains the primary information covered in the online quizzes for the class so it is important to read assigned chapters before doing the quiz each week. I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.
