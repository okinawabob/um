![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/MyMug150_2014.gif)This is a hybrid class and we will meet for one class per week and you will need to work through the course material online each week and do the weekly quiz covering the online content. Most of the content provided covers computing from a business perspective to support the *strategic objectives* of the business. The goal of using information systems is to enable strategic outcomes to achieve competitive advantage.  

If you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:  

<script>AntiSpam("moc", "003msfi+82.1lmr", "liamg", "CMST385", "")</script>

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the URL  
[http://islandman.org/um/ifsm300/](http://islandman.org/um/ifsm300/). 

I recommend you allocate approximately 15 hours per week to this course or approximately 120 hours over the next 8 weeks:

- Lecture = 3 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework assignments = 12 hours

[![ebook]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.pdf) UMUC has moved to free online resources to support all courses and there is a free 167 page eBook titled [Information Systems for Business and Beyond]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.pdf). The eBook contains the primary information covered in the online quizzes for the class so it is important to read assigned chapters before doing the quiz each week. I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.

### Assignment 2

Microsoft Access will be used to create a database for MIS. It will be considered a two-week assignment and will be due Week 5. Microsoft Access was never ported to MacOS. Therefore, MacOS users should do the database in the UMUC computer lab which utilizes Access 2010.

- [Assignment 2 - MIS Database]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/Asgn2-DB/Asgn2-DB.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
{: .todo}

Windows users have MS Access only in the Office Professional versions. MacOSX users will not have MS Access on any versions of MS Office, because Microsoft never ported the Access database application to MacOS. Therefore, you may want to use MS Access 2010 to do Assignment 2 in the UMUC Computer Lab/Testing Center.
