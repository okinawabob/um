![Week 0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk0.png)This is a hybrid class and we will meet for one class per week and you will need to work through the course material online each week and do the weekly quiz covering the online content. Most of the content provided covers computing from a business perspective to support the *strategic objectives* of the business. The goal of using information systems is to enable strategic outcomes to achieve competitive advantage.  

If you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:  

<script>AntiSpam("moc", "tsmc+82.1lmr", "liamg", "IFSM300", "")</script>

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the URL  
[http://islandman.org/um/ifsm300/](http://islandman.org/um/ifsm300/). 

I recommend you allocate approximately 15 hours per week to this course or approximately 120 hours over the next 8 weeks:

- Lecture = 2.5 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework assignments = 12 hours

[![ebook]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.pdf) UMUC has moved to free online resources to support all courses and there is a free 167 page eBook titled [Information Systems for Business and Beyond]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/ebook-300.pdf). The eBook and other provided documents contain the primary information covered in the online quizzes for the class so it is important to read assigned chapters before doing the quiz each week.

## Week 2: IT Infrastructure
{: #Week2 .anchor}

What does a business know about how it operates? How can a company leverage information technology to improve its operations?

In the previous week, we have discussed how information systems can help a business achieve a competitive advantage. This week,  you will learn what business processes are and how they are analyzed and improved using process analysis and reengineering. Then you will see how IT, when combined with business processes, can improve an organization’s competitive advantage. The hardware, software, and networking components of the technical infrastructure are combined to provide IT solutions that meet business objectives.

## Week 3: Databases
{: #Week3 .anchor}
  
What does a business know about its customers? Or its products? How could it use that information to increase sales and profits?

To answer questions like these, businesses collect and use data from many sources. This week you will learn about how data and information are used by organizations, including what the difference is between data and information, how data is created and stored, and how it is used throughout an organization in making business decisions.

Earlier week’s readings explained the importance of competitive advantage, the role IT plays in achieving the business strategy, and how business strategies drive planning for information technology. In many organizations, there is a position designated as a business analyst, the job of which is to help the organization translate business strategies into IT system solutions that improve the functioning of the organization. The business analyst may be a member of the IT department or may be assigned to a functional area (human resources, finance, manufacturing, etc.) of the organization. Throughout this course, you will assume the role of a business analyst and apply the course concepts in assignments.

### Assignment 2

Microsoft Access will be used to create a database for MIS. It will be considered a two-week assignment and will be due Week 5. Microsoft Access was never ported to MacOS. Therefore, MacOS users should do the database in the UMUC computer lab which utilizes Access 2010.

- [Assignment 2 - MIS Database]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm300/Asgn2-DB/Asgn2-DB.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
{: .todo}

Windows users have MS Access only in the Office Professional versions. MacOSX users will not have MS Access on any versions of MS Office, because Microsoft never ported the Access database application to MacOS. Therefore, you may want to use MS Access 2010 to do Assignment 2 in the UMUC Computer Lab/Testing Center.

Due to the loss of computer lab access, you may consider doing the optional Khan Academy tutorial for those that cannot install Microsoft Access on your personal computers (i.e. MacOS or ChromeOS) in lieu of the posted Assignment 2. If you chose this option then simply upload the resulting SQL code created for this assignment folder.

[SQL coding for a Simple Database - khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/sql-basics/pp/project-design-a-store-database)  

This interactive tutorial will introduce you to the basic structure of a database and the first set of SQL commands that are used to create and manipulate a database. You will not have to download any software - the tutorial and activities are completed totally online. You may work through the tutorial as many times as you wish.  You are encouraged to take notes or even print some of the screens that display the various SQL commands, how they are used, and the result of executing those commands. This will be your first experience with writing computer code and if you like it then I encourage you to enroll in CMIS102 or CMST385.

## Week 5: Information Systems Development
{: #Week5 .anchor}

Do we need a new system? What tasks should it perform? Who would use it? Where would it be housed? These are questions that a company must answer before purchasing an IT system. Without these answers, what kind of risks would the company run into if they tried to use a newly purchased IT system?

This week we will discuss how companies answer these types of questions. You will learn about how information systems are developed and how organizations decide whether to develop their systems in-house or to outsource the systems development. To begin, you will learn about the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a widely accepted framework for the design and development of IT systems. Before a system can be developed, we have to know what it is supposed to do. The tasks a system must perform or support are referred to as the requirements. It is also important to define how the system is expected to perform to deliver value to the users and to protect the data it houses. All of these lead to a decision as to whether the organization should build, buy, or outsource its IT solution. In addition to the “what, how, and why” of systems, it is helpful to have an understanding of the roles that people play (i.e., “who” is involved).

## Week 6: Project Planning
{: #Week6 .anchor}

This week, you will learn about IT project management and how it relates to the systems development life cycle (SDLC) process. You've heard the expression “plan the work and work the plan." But what does it take to develop an effective project plan and follow through to a successful completion? What technical and interpersonal skills do project managers need?

This week you will learn about how important an effective project manager is to the success of an IT project and what effective project management is all about.  Major tasks in an IT project include the selection of the system and the IT provider. You will learn about the most important aspects to consider for each of these tasks. Once those selections have been made, the project team will develop a plan for implementing the system, another area that we will cover this week.  You will have the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of these activities when you develop the final project and present next week.
