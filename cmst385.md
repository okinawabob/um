### So lets get started...

This is a fast paced mathematics course in an 8 week session.

I recommend you allocate approximately 18 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 6 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework = 12 hours per week
- Notebook computer running either: Linux, MacOS, or Windows
