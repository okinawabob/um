![.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk0.png)This is a classic Face-to-Face class and we meet entirely in person. There will be no online discussions and if you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:  

<script>AntiSpam("moc", "htam+82.1lmr", "liamg", "MATH103", "")</script>

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the hosting URL  
[http://islandman.org/um/math103/](http://islandman.org/um/math103/).

### So lets get started...

This is a fast paced mathematics course in an 8 week session.

I recommend you allocate approximately 20 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 6 hours per week
- Optional help session for one hour after each class = 2 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework = 12 hours per week or more if you are mathematically challenged
{: .check}

If you have a day job, I recommend that you enroll only in this course this session, because there will be a lot of homework. Unfortunately, UMUC is not enforcing the prerequisite for this course which is MATH012 and unprepared students may feel uncomfortable in this course. I give you this warning notification so you can properly allocate time for the course. The course has a common final exam for all UMUC sections worldwide. Therefore, I must remain on schedule to cover all topics.
  
[![ebook]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/ebook.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/Book-Complete.pdf) UMUC has moved to free online resources to support all courses and Will Tenney a UMUC faculty member has written a 433 page eBook titled [Math for Today's World]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/Book-Complete.pdf). The eBook contains examples and exercises for each section that we will use for the course. Answers to all odd numbered exercises are in the appendix at the end of the book. You are required to do the specified exercises at the end of each section, which will be odd numbered problems so you can check your answers. I have split this ebook in to multiple PDF files so you can simply download two chapters at a time and included bookmarks to aid in navigation for each chapter, sections, exercises and answers.

Please acquire the following items before the first class: 

- Spiral notebook or ring binder for doing all homework
- Several pencils or better a 0.7mm mechanical pencil with soft HB graphite
- Good Eraser
- ![TI-36XPro]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/pic_TI-30XPro.png) Buy a recommended multi-line display Scientific calculator:

  - **Canon F-719SG** [Reference Manual]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/F-719SG.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") @ MCX Price = $10.99

## Week 1: Number Theory and the Real Number System

[![Order of Operations]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/1s_PEMDAS.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/1_PEMDAS.jpg "Which grade did you learn PEMDAS?"){: .imgPopup}

This week we will be covering the *Real Number System* which is covered in Chapter 1 of the Math103 Book:
- 1.1 Signed Numbers and Order of Operation
- 1.2 Prime Factorization, GCF, LCM
- 1.3 Fractions also called Rational Numbers
- 1.4 Square Roots and Irrational Numbers
- 1.5 Exponents and Scientific Notation
{: .read}

The most important item to understand is the order of operation, which is 
described the acronym [P E MD AS]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/1_PEMDAS.jpg).

*[P E MD AS]: Parentheses > Exponents > Muliplication & division > Additon & Subtraction 

It is very important to do all assigned exercises in your homework notebook. Use enough paper to show the complete step-by-step process for each exercise. This is really for your benefit, so that you can track and learn from your mistakes. Chapter 1 is very important so that you have a firm foundation to build upon for the rest of the course. For the first week I have created a [Chapter 1 Exercise Solutions handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/eBookCh1Hmwk.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab"), which provides more detail then the answer key in the appendix.

**Test 1** is scheduled for week 3 first class and will cover content from or eBook Chapters 1, 2, and 3. Test 1 is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in one half page of single sided handwritten notes that is 8.5 inches x 5.5 inches. I suggest you simply take a standard letter size paper and fold it in half. You can add to these notes in Test 2 and 3.  You need to bring pencil, eraser, and calculator to Test 1.

This week we will begin with **Test 1** , which will cover content from eBook Chapters 1, 2, and 3. Test 1 is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in one page of handwritten notes on one side of an 8.5 inches x 5.5 inches area. You can add to these notes for test 2.  You can download and view [Sample Test 1 available here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/2012S1_test1.tst.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") with answers attached. I highly recommend that you attempt to do the Sample Test 1 and target completion within the 1 hour time frame of the actual test 1. 

You need to bring your own pencils, eraser, and calculator to Test 1 as they will not be provided. 

After Test 1, we will continue with eBook Chapter 4 covering the topics of *Polynomials, Factoring, and Quadratic Equations*:

- 4.1 Multiplying Algebraic Expressions and FOIL
- 4.2 Factoring and Problem Solving by Factoring
- 4.3 Quadratic Formula

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of second degree, having the general form:  

![Quadratic Equation Std Form]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/QuadraticEqStd.gif){: .equation}
{: .center}  
  
The letters *a*, *b* and *c* are called coefficients: *a* is the coefficient of *x*<sup>2</sup>, *b* is the coefficient of *x*, and *c* is the constant coefficient. A quadratic equation has two solutions (i.e., solutions for the unknown term *x*). In some cases, these solutions can have the same value. The values of the solutions can be computed using the quadratic formula as shown below:  

![Quadratic Formula]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/QuadraticFormStd.gif){: .equation}
{: .center}

For example, the solutions of the quadratic equation

![Quadratic Equation Example]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/QuadraticEqNum.gif){: .equation}
{: .center}

can be determined by first substituting 2 for *a*, -14 for *b*, and 20 for *c* in the quadratic forumula  

![Quadratic Formula Values]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/math103/QuadraticFormNum.gif){: .equation}
{: .center}

and then solving the expression, which gives the solutions of the equation as *x* = 5 and *x* = 2.

 The ac-Method is a very systematic factoring method that allows you to factor trinomial mathematical expressions. Once you understand how to use the ac-method you can usually find the factors much quicker than FOIL. I found several videos on youtube.com covering the ac-Method. Try working out the exercises illustrated in these videos to understand the step-by-step factoring process. Then try it on homework exercises.

Please bring your notebook contining homework, which I will examine for borderline grade cases. 
Please bring your Tests 1, 2, and 3 to me during the final exam time. I re-examine these tests when determining final grades if you are within a few points of the next grade in the course.  

I hope you feel are more comfortable with mathematics after taking this course and you will find it a useful skill when you apply it in life situations. It is your best critical thinking skill to help you make financial decisions. Mathematics is the basis of technology development and understanding physical sciences. If you would like to progress in mathematics, please take the placement test and request MATH107 College Algebra. MATH107 is transferable to all universities and colleges.
