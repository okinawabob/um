## IFSM201: Concepts and Applications of Information Technology


## Grading Information
<p>This is a hybrid class and your course grade will be determined based on graded items in the class which requires class attendance. If you do not attend 3 or more classes this will result in a grade of FN = Failure due to Non-attendance. If you cannot attend all classes please consider enrolling in the online version of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Items:</strong></p>
<p>Assessment items include Quizzes, Assignments, Discussions, and 90% passing score on Academic Integrity Tutorial. To receive all the points on the discussions you must post to each discussion and reply to two other class participants in each discussion before the due date.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quizzes worth 35% of grade. (Note due dates)</li>
<li>Assignments worth 50% of grade.&nbsp;(Note due dates)</li>
<li>Discussions requires responses worth 15% of grade.&nbsp;(Note due dates)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Course Grade Determination</strong></p>
<p>The course grade will be determined using the following percentages of total points for the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>A = 100 to 90%</li>
<li>B = 89.9% to 80%</li>
<li>C = 79.9% to 70%</li>
<li>D = 69.9% to 60%</li>
<li>F &lt; 60%</li>
</ul>


<h3>Weekly Classroom Discussion Topics and Participation</h3>
<p>Discussions (conducted in LEO) will facilitate the similar student-student interaction via the LEO classroom that is found in traditional classroom courses. Since we will meet once per week the online discussions will be approximately half of what you will find in an online class. You will need to respond to at least two other people for each discussion</p>
<h4>Policy for Classroom Discussions, E-Mail, and Messaging</h4>
<p>All students will be held to the highest standards for language and content in classroom discussions, e-mails and discussion&nbsp;interaction (including attachments).</p>
<p>Abusive, derogatory and inappropriate language and content, or personal attacks of any kind, will&nbsp;not be tolerated. Any student engaging in this type of behavior will be reported to the UMUC provost. Read the UMUC policy on the Code of Student Conduct, a link to which is located in the&nbsp;<strong>Academic Policies</strong>&nbsp;section below.</p>
<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
<p>Extra Credit is not available in this course. So please do your best on all assignments.</p>
<h3>Plagiarism Policy</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is an act or instance of using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author without authorization and the representation of that author's work as one's own, as by not crediting the original author. If you copy another students or copy an authors work without referencing it have commited plagarism. Such an act may result in automatic course failure and suspension.</p>
<h3>Policy on Late or Missed Assignments and Projects</h3>
<p>Assignments are expected to be submitted on time. Students have a long lead time in which to prepare, ask questions, and seek help. The late assignment&nbsp;penalty is 20% per day late and no points will be available after 5 days late. Unless a major accident, illness, or deployment (for active duty military), with supporting documentation, prevents a student from submitting his/her assignment on time. Late discussion posts will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Students should keep their instructor informed in advance about military deployments or other events that may impact their progress and participation in the course.</p>
<p>The handling of late assignments and the nature of the late penalty is at the sole discretion of the instructor in all situations.</p>
<p>No assignments will be accepted after the last day of class unless an Incomplete has been requested by the student before the final day of class and granted by the instructor.</p>




## Project Descriptions

<<h3>Academic Integrity Tutorial</h3>
<p>All students are required to complete the Academic Integrity Tutorial (found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.umuc.edu/students/academic-integrity/tutorial.cfm">https://www.umuc.edu/students/academic-integrity/tutorial.cfm</a>). This tutorial must be completed no later than the end of Week 5. No points are granted if the tutorial is not completed by the due date with a 90% or higher on the quiz. The quiz maybe taken multiple times.</p>
<h3>Discussions and Classroom Participation</h3>
<p>While participation is critical throughout the course, there will be graded Discussions (conducted in LEO).</p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>IFSM 201 will utilize module quizzes that cover content covered during the term. The content of the quizzes covers the module content each week and assigned reading so it is important to work through all&nbsp;content before attempting the quizzes.</p>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>Assignments address the following course outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use information technology effectively for personal and professional productivity</li>
<li>Use office applications effectively and efficiently for real-world use to organize, analyze, and communicate information</li>
</ul>
<h4>Assignment 1: Word Processing (Computer Shopping)</h4>
<p>For this assignment you will create a word processing document that describes the selection of a personal computer from a list of three that you find interesting. You will need to construct a table for this assignment that describes the computer components. You may shop online or at a retail store for this assignment.</p>
<h4>Assignment 2: Spreadsheets (Personal Budget)</h4>
<p>Students create a personal budget to demonstrate your ability to correctly create and format an Excel spreadsheet and incorporate appropriate formulas to provide a useful budgeting tool for personal financing. After completing your budget, students answer 3 &ldquo;critical thinking&rdquo; questions about your budget. Students may choose fictional data, but the items and amounts should be realistic. The spreadsheet file needs to be uploaded to LEO.</p>
<h4>Assignment 3:&nbsp;Website (Markdown)</h4>
<p>This assignment is designed to give student&rsquo;s an experience with computer coding using Markdown in the creation of a web site&nbsp;using GitHub.&nbsp;Students will develop three web pages for this web site in markdown code. You&nbsp;will&nbsp;link to hosted images and create structured text that is presented well.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Assignment 4: Databases (Project Management)</h4>
<p>This assignment is designed to apply the student&rsquo;s understanding of the assigned readings and information from lecture regarding databases. Students will create four database tables and populate them with specified data items. The tables will be linked together using one to many relationships using primary key and foreign key fields. A form and report will be created for the database. A query will be created using data items from two linked tables. The database file needs to be uploaded to LEO.</p>
<h4>Assignment 5: Presentation Graphics (Research Presentation)</h4>
<p>The research presentation assignment will require each student to make a presentation using slides created in a presentation graphics application such as PowerPoint. Each student will make a 12&nbsp;minute presentation to the class using 8 slides about some topic of interest related to computers. The student needs to cite three external reference from credible sources, and specify these using APA formatted references for their research on their slides. The presentation also needs to be uploaded to LEO.</p>
