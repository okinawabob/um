![Week 0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk0.png)This is a hybrid class and we will meet for one class per week and you will need to work through the course material online each week and submit weekly assignments. Most of the content provided covers computing from a programmers point of view to include data types and programming control structures. You weekly assignments will be analyzing a described problem and create a solution algorithm to solve the problem sequentially using a flowcharts. You will learn to convert a flowchart to code to make a working program. For this class we will use the Go language (Golang) developed by Google. It is a new and very powerful language that is designed for modern multi-core processors and networking. Go is primarily a command line compiled language that is best used with the [Visual Studio Code] editor. 

We will be utilizing [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) to do the flowchart algorithm and you may implement the program solution using scratch.

If you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the hosting URL  
[http://islandman.org/um/cmis102/](http://islandman.org/um/cmis102/).

### So lets get started...

This is a fast paced course in an 8 week session.

I recommend you allocate approximately 15 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 3 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework = 12 hours per week
- Notebook computer required running either: Linux, MacOS, or Windows
- Browser installed should be Chrome

Before the first class, I recommend that you download and print the latest updated version of the of the Syllabus and other Week 1 materials described below which are posted as PDF files. Windows users can use Adobe Acrobat Reader or [PDFXChangeViewer](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer)

I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.

## Week 1: What is Data?
{: #Week1 .week}

![.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk1.png)This week in lecture we will be discussing the Syllabus, LEO course management system, and investigate Data representation for different number types and characterÂ codes. If you enrolled in IFSM201 with me we will expanding coverage in this class to include signed integers, floating point representation for rational numbers, and unicode to write content in any human language. Prior to class, please print and read both PDF files listed below:

- [READ Number Systems and Codes Handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cmis102/NumSysCode_CMIS102.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
- [Slide Set 1: Computers and Programming Languages]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cmis102/01_ComputerLangJS.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
{: .pdf}

The LEO - Discussions are a kind of collective online discussion. This week you need to utilize five online discussions to introduce yourself and demonstrate that you have learned how to convert between various number systems and codes:

- Post your Introduction in the Discussion >> Introductions Topic
- Binary to Decimal Conversion
- Unsigned Binary addition
- Signed Binary Addition
- Convert your name from Unicode to Hexadecimal

#### Cyber-Cafe [Optional]

Post your non-course or course related comments or ramblings here. Maybe no one will read them except for me. Computers can be frustrating until you realize they are dumb binary machines and with good software we can fix that. That is what this course is about; How to write good procedural command line software in a programming language.

Programming can be fun and frustrating at times too, but a good lucrative career. The following video is what my first programming job was like. Computers are much better now.
