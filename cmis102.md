![Week 0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk0.png)This is a hybrid class and we will meet for one class per week and you will need to work through the course material online each week and submit weekly assignments. Most of the content provided covers computing from a programmers point of view to include data types and programming control structures. You weekly assignments will be analyzing a described problem and create a solution algorithm to solve the problem sequentially using a flowcharts. You will learn to convert a flowchart to code to make a working program.

We will learn the [JavaScript language](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-popular-is-javascript-in-2019-823712f7c4b1) which is one of the most popular interpreted languages in use today. The JavaScript interpreter is contained within all modern browsers and easy to access within an HTML document. JavaScript is the primary scripting language used for website development and also the JS in many WebApp frameworks such as: Node.js, React.js, Backbone.js, Vue.js, Hexo, and Gatsby. It is a great choice for beginners because it is loosely data typed and utilizes an interpreter which will abort when it encounters a line of code it doesn't understand. Please utilize the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser for the class.

We will be utilizing [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) to do the flowchart algorithm and you may implement the program solution using scratch.

A great cloud based solution to utilize for the class is https://repl.it/ and I highly recommend you get an account with them. If you have a github.com account from IFSM201 you can link it as your login or sign up using an email address. 

If you prefer to work offline then I recommend the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor.

If you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the hosting URL  
[islandman.org/um/cmis102/](http://islandman.org/um/cmis102/).

### So lets get started...

This is a fast paced course in an 8 week session.

I recommend you allocate approximately 15 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 3 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework = 12 hours per week
- Browser installed should be Chrome

Before the first class, I recommend that you download and print the latest updated version of the of the Syllabus and other Week 1 materials described below which are posted as PDF files. Windows users can use Adobe Acrobat Reader or [PDFXChangeViewer](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer)

I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.

## Week 1: What is Data?
{: #Week1 .week}

![.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk1.png)This week in lecture we will be discussing the Syllabus, LEO course management system, and investigate Data representation for different number types and characterÂ codes. If you enrolled in IFSM201 with me we will expanding coverage in this class to include signed integers, floating point representation for rational numbers, and unicode to write content in any human language. Prior to class, please print and read both PDF files listed below:

#### Cyber-Cafe [Optional]

Post your non-course or course related comments or ramblings here. Maybe no one will read them except for me. Computers can be frustrating until you realize they are dumb binary machines and with good software we can fix that. That is what this course is about; How to write good procedural command line software in a programming language.

Programming can be fun and frustrating at times too, but a good lucrative career. The following video is what my first programming job was like. Computers are much better now.
