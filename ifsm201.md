![Me](/assets/MyMug150_2014.gif)This is a classic Face-to-Face class and we meet entirely in person. There will be no online discussions and if you have a question you can ask in class or email me at:  

<script>AntiSpam("moc", "tsmc+82.1lmr", "liamg", "CMST385", "")</script>

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the hosting URL  
[http://islandman.org/umuc/cmst385/](http://islandman.org/umuc/cmst385/).

### So lets get started...

This is a fast paced mathematics course in an 8 week session.

I recommend you allocate approximately 18 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 6 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and homework = 12 hours per week
- Notebook computer running either: Linux, MacOS, or Windows

[![ebook](/assets/math103/ebook.jpg)](/assets/math103/Book-Complete.pdf) UMUC has moved to free online resources to support all courses and Will Tenney a UMUC faculty member has written a 433 page eBook titled [Math for Today's World](/assets/math103/Book-Complete.pdf). The eBook contains examples and exercises for each section that we will use for the course. Answers to all odd numbered exercises are in the appendix at the end of the book. You are required to do the specified exercises at the end of each section, which will be odd numbered problems so you can check your answers. I have split this ebook in to multiple PDF files so you can simply download two chapters at a time and included bookmarks to aid in navigation for each chapter, sections, exercises and answers.


I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.

![Success](/assets/Wk8.png)

The Final Exam is the last class of the term. The Final Exam is comprehensive and any material covered in this eight week course may be on the Final Exam. The Final Exam is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in pencils, eraser, calculator, [Formula Sheet](assets/math103/Math103FormulaSheetP1.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") and [z-Score Tables](assets/math103/Math103FormulaSheetP23.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab"). An example [Final Exam](assets/math103/Math%20103%20Practice%20Final%20Exam.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") and [Answers](Math 103 Practice Final Exam Solutions.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") can be downloaded and viewed here.  

Please bring your notebook contining homework, which I will examine for borderline grade cases. 
Please bring your Tests 1, 2, and 3 to me during the final exam time. I re-examine these tests when determining final grades if you are within a few points of the next grade in the course.

I hope you feel are more comfortable with mathematics after taking this course and you will find it a useful skill when you apply it in life situations. It is your best critical thinking skill to help you make financial decisions. Mathematics is the basis of technology development and understanding physical sciences. If you would like to progress in mathematics, please take the placement test and request MATH107 College Algebra. MATH107 is transferable to all universities and colleges.
