## Concepts and Applications of Information Technology 

![Start]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk0.png)This is a Hybrid class which meets one class per week for lecture and you are required to attend all lecture classes. In lieu of the second class, you are expected to work on assignments independently and work through all course content that is posted each week. Use of a computer, Internet connection, and [<abbr title="Learning Experience Online">LEO</abbr>](https://www.umuc.edu/current-students/learning-resources/leo/index.cfm) is required for hybrid classes which are accessed at either <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>:

- <http://campus.umuc.edu> (preferred)
- <http://learn.umuc.edu> (backup)
{: .link}

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the hosting  <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>: <http://islandman.org/um/ifsm201/>

You will be required to submit all assignments online using LEO, and emailed submissions will not be accepted. Consider this hybrid class as good training for taking an online class in the future. 

The Microsoft Office Professional Suite 2010, 2013, or 2016 is recommended for assignments because it is available in the UMUC computer lab/testing centers. One issue with Microsoft Office is that the adaptive ribbon User Interface changes significantly with each version so it is sometimes difficult to find the command you want when switching between versions. Another issue is that only Microsoft Professional version has the Microsoft Access database application and Microsoft never ported MS Access to its MacOS version of MS Office. For the database assignment we will do the assignment in the UMUC computer lab which has MS Access.

LEO Course Resources contain a link to GCFLearnfree.org, a project of the Goodwill Community Foundation® which has an excellent collection of MS Office tutorials for all versions. Links to tutorials are provided in Course Content pages and you should select the version of Microsoft Office that you have installed on your computer. Links to Microsoft Office 2010 Bible and also Microsoft Office 2013 Bible are also available in the course resources. Also in the course content is a link with instructions to download Microsoft Office 365 (Windows) or Microsoft Office 2016 (MacOS).

Alternatively, you may use the free LibreOffice, which is available at <http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/> and functions equally well on Windows 7-10, MacOSX, and Linux. Good documentation is available at <http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/> and I recommend you download and read the LibreOffice Getting Started Guide if you chose to use this freeware software. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice open-source software and is more actively developed. However, if you use LibreOffice you need to submit all files in the native MS Office formats: *.docx, *.xlsx, *.accdb, or *.pptx for this and future online classes. Please do not submit documents using the MacOS pages or numbers file formats as your instructor cannot read them and you will receive a zero on the assignment.

Please bring a USB Drive that is 1 GigaByte or greater to class this week and every week. It is best if the USB Drive attaches to your key ring to avoid loss. You may use the UMUC computer lab to work on your assignments. Keep all files on your USB Drive if you intend to use the UMUC computer lab or your home computer to do your assignments. You may want to install LibreOffice to your USB Drive using <https://portableapps.com/>, which will allow it to run on any Windows computer including the ones in UMUC Computer Lab. 

If you have a technical problem in your LEO class, contact Help@UMUC at <http://help.umuc.edu/> or by phone at 1-888-360-UMUC (8682). Help@UMUC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

### So lets get started...  

I recommend you allocate approximately 12 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 3 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and assignments = 9 hours per week

## Week 1: Data and Information
{: #Week1 .anchor}

![qr]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk1.png)This week in lecture we will be discussing the Syllabus, LEO course management system, and investigate Data representation for different number systems used in computing and ASCII codes. Data is gathered, analyzed, and organized into meaningful and useful information.  But do you know the difference between quantitative, qualitative and categorical data? And how is data gathered?  What is the difference between samples, surveys, and polls. 

Information is data that has meaning; it tells a story. So how do you go from just gathering data to making some meaning of what you have gathered? What does data analysis mean?

### Content this week

Begin this week with the reading about the power of data and information. The Week 1 Quiz will contain questions based on these two readings. Prior to class, please print and read both PDF files listed below:

- [READ Number Systems and Codes Handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/READ-NumberSystemsCodes.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
- [READ Data and Information Handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/DataInformation.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
{: .pdf}

The *file extension* is important in Microsoft Windows, because it determines which application will open the file. Unfortunately, Microsoft hides file extensions by default, but it is useful to view the file extensions of known file types within Windows Explorer file display pane. If you are using windows please search through help to learn how to view the file extensions. Find and uncheck the check box labeled Hide extensions of known file types. You will now be able to see the difference between filename.docx file and filename.pdf file.

## Week 3: Software and Spreadsheets
{: #Week3 .anchor}

![os]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/Wk3.png) This week you will cover software - both system software (operating systems and utilities) and application software. First, you will look at the relationship between the hardware studied last week and the *Operating System* software that enables the hardware to function in a way that supports the user. Next, you will look more closely at the operating system and the utilities that are essential to make a computer function. Finally, you will review software application packages that are most commonly used for personal and work computer-related functions.

A computer can run only one type of Operating System at a time and the two most common OS's for personal computers are Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS. Linux has many variants and is most common on servers, but can also run on personal compters. For the smart phone devices the two most common operating systems are Google's Android OS and Apples iOS.  You should work through the GCF LearnFree.org tutorials for the operating system that you most commonly use on your personal computer before taking the Quiz.

- [Assignment 3: Relational Database]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/Asgn3-RelationalDB.pdf)
{: .pdf}

MS Access is only available in the Office Professional versions. MacOSX users will not have MS Access on any versions of MS Office, because Microsoft has never ported the Access database application to MacOS. Therefore, if you would like to utilize MS Access to do Assignment 3 you will likely need to utilize the UMUC Computer Lab/Testing Center to utilize MS Access 2010. However, if you have Microsoft Access on your home computer and wish to try it there then go to the appropriate version of Access for tutorials.

You should be doing it with the Chrome browser and print the certificate as a PDF file and upload to LEO in the appropriate assignment folder.

### Content this week

This week we will be discussing Databases in preparation for Assignment 3. I will utilize PowerPoint slides for lecture and discussion. Please print the following PDF files and read the first two documents prior to class and before taking Quiz 4.

- [Databases - Knowledge Management - Business Intelligence]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/4-Databases-KnowledgeManagement-BusinessIntelligence.pdf)
- [CRM, Data Warehouses and Data Mining/Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/4-CRM-DataWarehouses-DataMining-Analytics.pdf)
- [Slide Set 6: Databases]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/4-Databases.pdf)
- [Assignment 3: Relational Database]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifsm201/Asgn3-RelationalDB.pdf)
{: .pdf}

MS Access is only available in the Office Professional versions. MacOSX users will not have MS Access on any versions of MS Office, because Microsoft has never ported the Access database application to MacOS. Therefore, if you would like to utilize MS Access to do Assignment 3 you will likely need to utilize the UMUC Computer Lab/Testing Center to utilize MS Access 2010. However, if you have Microsoft Access on your home computer and wish to try it there then go to the appropriate version of Access for tutorials.
