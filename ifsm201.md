## Concepts and Applications of Information Technology 

![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Wk1.png)This is a Hybrid class which meets one class per week for lecture and you are required to attend all lecture classes. In lieu of the second class, you are expected to work on assignments independently and work through all course content that is posted each week. Use of a computer, Internet connection, and [<abbr title="Learning Experience Online">LEO</abbr>](https://www.umuc.edu/current-students/learning-resources/leo/index.cfm) is required for hybrid classes which are accessed at either <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>:

- <http://campus.umuc.edu> (preferred)
- <http://learn.umuc.edu> (backup)
{: .link}

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the hosting  <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>: <http://islandman.org/um/ifsm201/>

You will be required to submit all assignments online using LEO, and emailed submissions will not be accepted. Consider this hybrid class as good training for taking an online class in the future. 

The Microsoft Office Professional Suite 2010, 2013, or 2016 is recommended for assignments because it is available in the UMUC computer lab/testing centers. One issue with Microsoft Office is that the adaptive ribbon User Interface changes significantly with each version so it is sometimes difficult to find the command you want when switching between versions. Another issue is that only Microsoft Professional version has the Microsoft Access database application and Microsoft never ported MS Access to its MacOS version of MS Office. For the database assignment we will do the assignment in the UMUC computer lab which has MS Access.

LEO Course Resources contain a link to GCFLearnfree.org, a project of the Goodwill Community Foundation® which has an excellent collection of MS Office tutorials for all versions. Links to tutorials are provided in Course Content pages and you should select the version of Microsoft Office that you have installed on your computer. Links to Microsoft Office 2010 Bible and also Microsoft Office 2013 Bible are also available in the course resources. Also in the course content is a link with instructions to download Microsoft Office 365 (Windows) or Microsoft Office 2016 (MacOS).

Alternatively, you may use the free LibreOffice, which is available at <http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/> and functions equally well on Windows 7-10, MacOSX, and Linux. Good documentation is available at <http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/> and I recommend you download and read the LibreOffice Getting Started Guide if you chose to use this freeware software. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice open-source software and is more actively developed. However, if you use LibreOffice you need to submit all files in the native MS Office formats: *.docx, *.xlsx, *.accdb, or *.pptx for this and future online classes. Please do not submit documents using the MacOS pages or numbers file formats as your instructor cannot read them and you will receive a zero on the assignment.

Please bring a USB Drive that is 1 GigaByte or greater to class this week and every week. It is best if the USB Drive attaches to your key ring to avoid loss. You may use the UMUC computer lab to work on your assignments. Keep all files on your USB Drive if you intend to use the UMUC computer lab or your home computer to do your assignments. You may want to install LibreOffice to your USB Drive using <https://portableapps.com/>, which will allow it to run on any Windows computer including the ones in UMUC Computer Lab. 

If you have a technical problem in your LEO class, contact Help@UMUC at <http://help.umuc.edu/> or by phone at 1-888-360-UMUC (8682). Help@UMUC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

### So lets get started...  

I recommend you allocate approximately 12 hours per week to this course:

- Lecture = 3 hours per week
- Reading study, video watching, and assignments = 9 hours per week

## Week 1: Data and Information
{: #Week1 .anchor}

This week in lecture we will be discussing the Syllabus, LEO course management system, and investigate Data representation for different number systems used in computing and ASCII codes. Data is gathered, analyzed, and organized into meaningful and useful information.  But do you know the difference between quantitative, qualitative and categorical data? And how is data gathered?  What is the difference between samples, surveys, and polls. 

Information is data that has meaning; it tells a story. So how do you go from just gathering data to making some meaning of what you have gathered? What does data analysis mean?

### Content this week

Begin this week with the reading about the power of data and information. The Week 1 Quiz will contain questions based on these two readings. Prior to class, please print and read both PDF files listed below:

- [READ Number Systems and Codes Handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifms201/READ-NumberSystemsCodes.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
- [READ Data and Information Handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ifms201/DataInformation.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")
{: .pdf}

The *file extension* is important in Microsoft Windows, because it determines which application will open the file. Unfortunately, Microsoft hides file extensions by default, but it is useful to view the file extensions of known file types within Windows Explorer file display pane. If you are using windows please search through help to learn how to view the file extensions. Find and uncheck the check box labeled Hide extensions of known file types. You will now be able to see the difference between filename.docx file and filename.pdf file.

If you have any questions about the class or assignments feel free to post in the 
LEO Discussion > Ask your Professor.

### Activities this week

The ***<abbr title="Learning Experience Online">LEO</abbr> Discussions*** are a kind of collective online discussion that is visable to all students. The discussion activites this week will provide you with an understanding of digital data, which is fundamental to understanding How computers work. 

#### 5 Discussion topics must be completed before our next class

This week you need to utilize five online discussion topics to introduce yourself and demonstrate that you have learned how to convert between various number systems and codes:

- Post your Introduction in the Discussion >> Introductions Topic
- Post in the Number System and Codes Conversion Discussion >> 
  - Binary to Decimal Conversion Topic
  - Binary to Hexadecimal conversion Topic
